Actress Jessica Alba co-founded the company that focuses mainly on providing non-toxic household products to supply the market for ethical consumerism. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honest_Company">Honest Company</a> has witnessed a remarkable growth ever since it was founded. The company serves Canada and the United States. It has raised a number of venture capital and is currently targeting to launch an initial public offering in future.</p><p><strong>How Did <a href="https://twitter.com/Honest">The Honest Company</a> Start?</strong><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicaalba/?hl=en">Jessica Alba</a> got the inspiration to create a company that offered an alternative to the <a href="https://www.honest.com/baby">common baby products</a> using ingredients such as synthetic fragrances and petrochemicals. This was back in 2008 when she gave birth to her first born child, and wished to provide alternative and safer products given the history she had with childhood illnesses. She became more concerned and serious about starting the company when a product that her mother had recommended caused her child to suffer a welt outbreak. Jessica Alba took about three years to get her business partners on board. They are Brian Lee (CEO), Sean Kane (COO) and Christopher Gavigan (chief product officer). The company opened its doors in 2011 dealing with 17 products.</p><p><strong>Honest Company Operations</strong><br>As she molded her business, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Alba">Alba</a> lobbied the US Congress to bring about stringent rules requiring the testing of children’s toys and clothing. In 2013, the company made sales of $50 million and by November 2014, it had managed to employ 275 employees and was projected to get sales amounting to $150 million that year. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/honest/?hl=en">The Honest Company made</a> 80% of its total sales online as it offers its products through a monthly payment service while the rest of the sales are done in discount warehouses and department stores. In 2014, the company eventually managed to make sales of $170 million. In the summer of 2014, the company managed to get $70 million from venture capitalists as it prepared for an imminent IPO. This made its value rise to $1 billion.</p><p><strong>Honest Company Distributors and Products</strong><br><a href="https://www.costco.com/">Costco</a> and <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a> were the first initial distributors for the company. By mid 2014, a number of other stores were selling the company’s products like <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/">Nordstrom</a> and Buy Buy Baby. By the end of the year 2014, the company was dealing in 90 products with diapers being the leading product on its sales. The Honest Company is popular due to its eco-friendly products and guarantee that it does not use any compounds or chemicals that compromise on health.
